Project for learning through [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) (TOP). 

[TOP](https://www.theodinproject.com/) is an open-source curriculum to learn full-stack web development. This is the first project they assign to their students: a complete webpage with the design they provide, using [Flexbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_flexible_box_layout/Basic_concepts_of_flexbox). The page content is completely the developer's choice.

Although responsiveness wasn't required, I still focused on it by using Flexbox with flex-wrap and media queries. It's not fully responsive yet because I didn't use JavaScript to implement the dropdown menu for mobile navigation, but I plan to update it soon.

## Preview

## Goal
The main goal of this project was to apply and practice the Flexbox concepts I learned in [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) study guide. At the same time, I was able to implement my knowledge of HTML and CSS.

## Content
[The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) provided the desired layout and a file with colors and fonts to use, but left the content up to the developer. Thinking quickly, I came up with the idea of creating a webpage about my city, [Lorena](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorena_(S%C3%A3o_Paulo)), in the state of SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil. I added important information about the city that I would share with someone from outside Brazil.

To make my content fit the TOP design layout, I combined the city information with a section containing a button for tourists to book a hotel. With this idea, I can not only promote the city but also create a space for hotel ads. And remember, everything is just visual on a single page.

## Contribute
I'm currently learning HTML and CSS. I wrote this text on 24/02/2025 and i started studying at the beginning of January, so contributions are definitely welcome! If you spot any issues or have suggestions for improvements, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request to the repository.
